He studied with the International Veterinary Acupuncture Society in 1997 and began attending Chi Institute of Chinese Medicine (<a href="http://www.tcvm.com"><span class="STYLE9">www.tcvm.com</span></a>) classes in 1998. Bruce has been one of the key speakers at the Chi Institute in Reddick, FL USA since 2000. Bruce lectures at veterinary colleges and at scientific meetings nationally and internationally in the field of TCVM. He is the president of the American Association of TCVM (<a href="http://www.aatcvm.org" ><span class="STYLE9">www.aatcvm.org</span></a>) and on the executive board of the Veterinary Botanical Medicine Association. Bruce has published many papers and chapters in veterinary journals and texts, as well as co-authored the book “Application of Tui-Na in Veterinary Medicine”. He is an assistant editor to the American Journal of TCVM.<br />
                          Dr. Bruce Ferguson moved from the US to Perth, Western Australia in 2007. He works as an Adjunct Senior Lecturer at the Murdoch University’s Veterinary School, where he is also a consultant in TCVM. Bruce has also started the Western Australian TCVM Herbal Medicine course since Nov. 2007. This is a quote from one of the participants, Dr. Clare Middle: “Dr Ferguson is an excellent teacher, both in handing over basic knowledge thoroughly, and also being able to answer more obscure questions. It certainly shows that his training has involved years of sitting in lectures, often repeatedly, given by masters of this subject, and extensive experience in the form of case loads and teaching others”.</div></td>

After graduation, she moved to Bunbury in Western Australia (following her horse vet  husband Graham) and worked in mixed practice (80% small animal, 20 % cattle) for  9 years. She became a partner in the business within the first six months, but  sold her share to her partner after having her first child. She then gained her  Master’s in Small Animal Medicine, and her Australian College Membership (Small  Animal Medicine), while doing locums. After her second child, she and Graham  started a small animal clinic to complement the horse practice which Graham had  purchased. Later they also bought back the Bunbury Veterinary Clinic. Flip’s  interest in complementary medicine began in 1998 following a weekend  acupuncture clinic. Reiki followed, and Bach and Bush Flower Essences. In 2000,  she enrolled in the IVAS acupuncture course, because having seen fantastic  results from “cookbook” acupuncture, she thought that if she actually  understood what she was doing, it may work better!!? She has a particular interest in  musculoskeletal disorders and physical therapies, and uses trigger point work  and Bowen therapy in conjunction with acupuncture in some cases. Since the  arrival of the wonderful Bruce  Ferguson in the West, she has started her Chinese Herb studies and has seen  some wonderful results with these also.<br />
